# Validate sub seqence

```
Ex :- arr = [-5,1,22,25,6,-1,8,10]
      sequence = [1,6,-1,10]

      Subsequence care about orders. If we remove elements from main array order of sequence should not change. 

      6 comes after 1 in main array
      -1 comes after 6 
      10 comes after -1 
      
      [1,6,10,-1] is not a subsequence

      Optimal time complexity = O(n)
      Space complexity = O(1)
